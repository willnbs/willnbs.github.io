 <h1 style="font-size:60px"><strong>Enabling the heating and cooling transition: A Strategic Workshop for Cross-Border Cooperation on Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES)</strong></h1>
  <p>Building new partnerships capable of answering key research questions begins by understanding the available skills, expertise and capacity among a diverse group of stakeholders. 
    This understanding can never develop while working in silos. The workshop proposed herein thus seeks to use the Joint Forum as an opportunity to catalyse interdisciplinary cross-border collaboration through a simulated interactive bid-writing process. 
    This process centres around large scale inter-seasonal thermal energy storage as a core component in reducing the carbon intensity of heating and cooling systems in both Scotland and Lower Saxony. 
By supporting electrification and energy efficiency initiatives, energy storage has the potential to catalyse heat network build out, helping to meet the targets set at governmental level. 
    The German Federal Ministry, through the Heat Planning Act, has set the requirement that each municipality formulate heating plans: large cities must meet this requirement by 30 June 2026 while municipalities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants by 20 June 2028 (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Energie, 2024). 
    By 2045, heat supply in Germany aims to be cost-efficient, sustainable, economical, affordable, resilient, and greenhouse gas-neutral. Meanwhile, the UK, including Scotland, has also decentralised heat zoning responsibilities to regional or council authorities, for example The Heat Networks (Scotland) Act (2021). 
    An interdisciplinary understanding of heat network technologies is key to designing sustainable plans in both regions, including surface and subsurface masterplans. 
A sustainable transition to low-emission heating and cooling demands a mix of technologies capable of offer flexibility and efficiency in an energy system increasingly powered by intermittent renewable energy sources.  
    Given the importance of such characteristics, energy storage must be recognised as a linchpin between non-dispatchable generation and non-flexible load profiles; a conflict that arises across multiple timeframes, from seconds to seasons. 
    While short-term energy storage is increasingly grid-connected, sustainable large-scale inter-seasonal storage remains relatively absent from the energy systems of Germany and Scotland (UK Parliament, 2024).  
    Recent funding calls centre on developing “critical solutions needed to store energy in large volumes from season to season in ways that are safe, economical and efficient, to enable the UK to take advantage of the growth in renewable energy generation" (UKRI, 2025). 
    At a European level, the Horizon Europe (2025) seeks to accelerate the key strategic orientations of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, namely green and digital transitions towards climate neutrality. 
    In combination, the work programme seeks to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Under this context, the European call emphasises Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) in dense urban areas as a key topic for further research, development and deployment, including borehole, aquifer and mine-water thermal energy storage system. By exchanging ideas across disciplines and borders, the siloed potential to advance research into this important subject can be revealed and a deeper mutual understanding of the ECAS partnership can be realised.
