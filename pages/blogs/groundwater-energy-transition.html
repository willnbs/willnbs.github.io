              <p>
                In 2022, the United Nations and associated working groups published ‘The Hidden Wealth of Nations’ evoking the paradox of value presented in Adam Smith’s influential work of almost 250 years earlier. The paradox had been discussed by preceding philosophers Plato, John Locke and others, although it is encapsulated eloquently in Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations:
              </p> 
               <p>
                 `The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called "value in use;" the other, "value in exchange." 
                The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarcely anything; scarcely anything can be had in exchange for it. 
                A diamond, on the contrary, has scarcely any use-value; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.
               </p>
              <p>
                This paradox of low value-in-exchange despite high value-in-use is perhaps exemplified no better than in the case of water, and in-extremum groundwater. 
                The real value in exchange, Smith believed, was an expression of the ‘toil and trouble of acquiring it.’ 
              In regions of increasing pressure on groundwater resources and scare alternatives the ‘toil and trouble’ will undoubtedly rise. The impacts of the invisible resource have become, and will increasingly become, painfully visible.
